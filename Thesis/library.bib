abstract = {Radiation is an important process of energy transport, a force, and a basis for synthetic observations, so radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) calculations have occupied an important place in astrophysics. However, although the progress in computational technology is remarkable, their high numerical cost is still a persistent problem. In this work, we compare the following schemes used to solve the nonlinear simultaneous equations of an RHD algorithm with the flux-limited diffusion approximation: the Newton–Raphson (NR) method, operator splitting, and linearization (LIN), from the perspective of the computational cost involved. For operator splitting, in addition to the traditional simple operator splitting (SOS) scheme, we examined the scheme developed by Douglas {\&} Rachford (DROS). We solve three test problems (the thermal relaxation mode, the relaxation and the propagation of linear waves, and radiating shock) using these schemes and then compare their dependence on the time step size. As a result, we find the conditions of the time step size necessary for adopting each scheme. The LIN scheme is superior to other schemes if the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure is sufficiently low. On the other hand, DROS can be the most efficient scheme if the ratio is high. Although the NR scheme can be adopted independently of the regime, especially in a problem that involves optically thin regions, the convergence tends to be worse. In all cases, SOS is not practical.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an update on the open source MPI-AMRVAC simulation toolkit where we focus on solar- and non-relativistic astrophysical magneto-fluid dynamics. We highlight recent developments in terms of physics modules such as hydrodynamics with dust coupling and the conservative implementation of Hall magnetohydrodynamics. A simple conservative high-order finite difference scheme that works in combination with all available physics modules is introduced and demonstrated at the example of monotonicity preserving fifth order reconstruction. Strong stability preserving high order Runge-Kutta time steppers are used to obtain stable evolutions in multidimensional applications realizing up to fourth order accuracy in space and time. With the new distinction between active and passive grid cells, MPI-AMRVAC is ideally suited to simulate evolutions where parts of the solution are controlled analytically, or have a tendency to progress into or out of a stationary state. Typical test problems and representative applications are discussed, with an outlook to follow-up research. Finally, we discuss the parallel scaling of the code and demonstrate excellent weak scaling up to 30 000 processors allowing to exploit modern petascale infrastructure.},

abstract = {We perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the structure and dynamics of the radiation-dominated envelopes of massive stars at the location of the iron opacity peak. One-dimensional hydrostatic calculations predict an unstable density inversion at this location, whereas our simulations reveal a complex interplay of convective and radiative transport whose behavior depends on the ratio of the photon diffusion time to the dynamical time. The latter is set by the ratio of the optical depth per pressure scale height, , 0 t to c c , c g t = where c 50 km s g 1 » -is the isothermal sound speed in the gas alone. When , 0 c t t  convection reduces the radiation acceleration and removes the density inversion. The turbulent energy transport in the simulations agrees with mixing length theory and provides its first numerical calibration in the radiation-dominated regime. When , 0 c t t  convection becomes inefficient and the turbulent energy transport is negligible. The turbulent velocities exceed c g , driving shocks and large density fluctuations that allow photons to preferentially diffuse out through low-density regions. However, the effective radiation acceleration is still larger than the gravitational acceleration so that the time average density profile contains a modest density inversion. In addition, the simulated envelope undergoes large-scale oscillations with periods of a few hours. The turbulent velocity field may affect the broadening of spectral lines and therefore stellar rotation measurements in massive stars, while the time variable outer atmosphere could lead to variations in their mass loss and stellar radius.},

abstract = {A diffusion theory for radiative transfer is derived which is naturally flux limited, i.e., the magnitude of the flux can be no greater than the density times the maximum transport speed. Numerical comparisons with exact solutions of the equation of transfer indicate that this approxi-mate theory is significantly more accurate than classical isotropic diffusion theory (the Eddington approximation) and asymptotic diffusion theory. Subject heading: radiative transfer In many problems involving transport theory one is often forced by computational or cost considerations to adopt some approximate method to handle the transport phenomena. By far the most common such methods in use today involve approximating the angular information by various forms of the diffusion (differential) approximation, typically based upon equihbrium diffusion theory (EDT, Pomraning 1973), isotropic diffusion theory (IDT, Larsen and Keller 1974), or asymptotic diffusion theory (ADT, Pomraning 1973; Case, de Hoffmann, and Placzek 1953; Winslow 1968). All these theories impose restrictions on significant spatial variations over distances of a mean free path, and all yield expressions for the flux of energy or particles which can violate causality (the magnitude of the flux can be no greater than the density times the maximum transport speed) when these restrictions are exceeded. While these constraints are reasonable for many physical problems, they are often violated for radiative transfer problems that arise in astrophysics and plasma physics. In the past this has led to the ad hoc introduction of a flux-hmiter (Winslow 1968; Lund and Wilson 1980), usually with some degree of arbitrariness, in order to preserve causahty in the presence of large spatial gradients. It is the purpose of this paper to present a diffusion theory which is naturally flux-hmited, and thus relaxes some of the restrictions usually necessary for the valid application of diffusion theory. We will refer to this approximate transport description as flux-limited diffusion theory (FDT). The setting of what follows will be radiative transfer, although the analysis makes no special use of this fact and is equally applicable to any one-speed transport problem. The generalization to frequency dependent (multigroup) problems can be accomplished as Winslow (1968) did in the ADT setting. For simplicity, only the case of isotropic elastic (coherent) scattering will be treated here, but the procedure can be applied to a more general scattering description. The outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows: The next section derives the flux-hmited diffusion equation, and discusses various limiting forms of the theory, as well as its connection with IDT and ADT. The FDT equation obtained is nonlinear, but we show in III that certain problems are solvable in closed analytic form. Section IV discusses the initial and boundary conditions that are necessary to complete the theory, and numerical comparisons of IDT, ADT, and FDT with exact transport results are presented in V. We close with a few summary remarks in the where r, Q, and t are the spatial, angular, and temporal variables, c is the speed of light, a 0 (r, t) is the absorption coefficient, {\textless}j s (r, t) is the scattering coefficient, o—o a +{\textless}j 5 is the total interaction coefficient, Z?(r, t) is the blackbody energy density, and E(r,t) is the radiation energy density as defined by},

abstract = {The high luminosity of Very Massive Stars (VMS) means that radiative forces play an important, dynamical role both in the structure and stability of their stellar envelope, and in driving strong stellar-wind mass loss. Focusing on the interplay of radiative flux and opacity, with emphasis on key distinctions between continuum vs. line opacity, this chapter reviews instabilities in the envelopes and winds of VMS. Specifically, we discuss how: 1) the iron opacity bump can induce an extensive inflation of the stellar envelope; 2) the density dependence of mean opacity leads to strange mode instabilities in the outer envelope; 3) desaturation of line-opacity by acceleration of near-surface layers initiates and sustains a line-driven stellar wind outflow; 4) an associated line-deshadowing instability leads to extensive small-scale structure in the outer regions of such line-driven winds; 5) a star with super-Eddington luminosity can develop extensive atmospheric structure from photon bubble instabilities, or from stagnation of flow that exceeds the "photon tiring" limit; 6) the associated porosity leads to a reduction in opacity that can regulate the extreme mass loss of such continuum-driven winds. Two overall themes are the potential links of such instabilities to Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and the potential role of radiation forces in establishing the upper mass limit of VMS.},
