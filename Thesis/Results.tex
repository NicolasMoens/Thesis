\chapter{Results}
The first result is of course a working CAK subroutine and FLD module in mpi-AMRVAC. This is something that didn't exist before and it will open the way toward simulations of new physical regimes where radiation plays a role in the dynamics of the system. Other than writing the software, there are also some results. These will be described in this chapter.
